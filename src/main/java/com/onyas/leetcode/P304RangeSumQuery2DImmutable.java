 * Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper
 * left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * Given matrix = [
 * [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
 * [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
 * [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
 * [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
 * [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]
 * ]
 * Note:
 * You may assume that the matrix does not change.
 * There are many calls to sumRegion function.
 * You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.
 * sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
 * sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2) -> 11
 * sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4) -> 12
 * Note:
 * You may assume that the matrix does not change.
 * There are many calls to sumRegion function.
 * You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.
